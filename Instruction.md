# Instructions

The details of the .sql scripts are located inside the script files or in the respective .md file. Follow these instructions to set up and use the database:

## Database Setup

1. **Create Schema and Tables:**
   - Use the contents of the `Database.sql` file inside the `Database` folder to create the schema and tables for the database.
   - If you only need individual tables, refer to the `Tables` folder inside the `Database` folder for separate table scripts.

2. **Complete Database Setup:**
   - Use `DatabaseComplete.sql` for a comprehensive setup that includes everything: schema, tables, triggers, sample data, and more.

3. **MYSQL Workbench Model:**
   - If you prefer to view the database model visually, open `Database.mwb` in MYSQL Workbench. 
   - To do this, open MYSQL Workbench and navigate to `File > Open Model`.

## Running Scripts

- **Insert, Select (Listar), Triggers, Procedures, and Functions:**
  - To execute these scripts, navigate to your database and paste the code from the respective folders into your SQL editor.

By following these steps, you will set up and use the database efficiently. For more detailed instructions, refer to the script files or the accompanying .md files.
